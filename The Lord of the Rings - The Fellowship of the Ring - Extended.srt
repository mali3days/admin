1
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,619
<i>The world is changed.</i>

2
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,789
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

3
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,460
<i>I feel it in the earth.</i>

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,048
<i>I smell it in the air.</i>

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,341
<i>Much that once was...</i>

6
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,135
<i>is lost.</i>

7
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,847
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

8
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:14,156
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.</i>

9
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,325
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

10
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,287
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.</i>

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,415
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

12
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,587
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.</i>

13
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,297
<i>And nine...</i>

14
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,509
<i>nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...</i>

15
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,554
<i>who, above all else, desire power.</i>

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,894
<i>For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.</i>

17
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,565
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

18
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,901
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

19
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,322
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...</i>

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,202
<i>the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...</i>

21
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,454
<i>to control all others.</i>

22
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,625
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...</i>

23
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,046
<i>and his will to dominate all life.</i>

24
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,884
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

25
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,387
<i>One by one...</i>

26
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:23,267
<i>the Free Lands of Middle-Earth
fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

27
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,520
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,650
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,488
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth.</i>

30
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,438
<i>Victory was near.</i>

31
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,944
<i>But the power of the Ring...</i>

32
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,197
<i>could not be undone.</i>

33
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,723
<i>It was in this moment...</i>

34
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,309
<i>when all hope had faded...</i>

35
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,647
<i>that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.</i>

36
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,226
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-Earth, was defeated.</i>

37
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,277
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...</i>

38
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,698
<i>who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

39
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,534
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

40
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,245
<i>are easily corrupted.</i>

41
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,125
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

42
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,944
<i>It betrayed Isildur...</i>

43
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,198
<i>to his death.</i>

44
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,248
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...</i>

45
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,792
<i>were lost.</i>

46
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,837
<i>History became legend...</i>

47
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,048
<i>legend became myth.</i>

48
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,134
<i>And for
two and a half thousand years...</i>

49
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,013
<i>the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.</i>

50
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,475
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

51
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,270
<i>it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

52
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:01,443
My precious.

53
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,237
<i>The Ring came
to the creature Gollum...</i>

54
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,325
<i>who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.</i>

55
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,495
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

56
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,789
It came to me.

57
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,418
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:23,340
My precious.

59
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,389
<i>The Ring brought
to Gollum unnatural long life.</i>

60
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,434
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

61
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:39,231
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.</i>

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,692
<i>Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.</i>

63
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,779
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

64
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,782
<i>whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

65
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,285
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

66
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,288
<i>its time had now come.</i>

67
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,377
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

68
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,549
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

69
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,971
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

70
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,222
What's this?

71
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,890
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

72
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,810
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

73
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,770
<i>A ring.</i>

74
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,856
Lost!

75
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,070
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,573
<i>For the time will soon come...</i>

77
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,995
<i>when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.</i>

78
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,836
<i>The 22nd day of September...</i>

79
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,212
<i>in the year 1400...</i>

80
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,049
<i>by Shire-reckoning.</i>

81
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:54,139
<i>Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...</i>

82
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,892
<i>the Shire...</i>

83
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,895
<i>Middle-Earth.</i>

84
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,861
<i>The Third Age of this world.</i>

85
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,418
<i>There and Back Again:</i>

86
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,795
<i>A Hobbit's Tale.</i>

87
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,465
<i>By Bilbo Baggins.</i>

88
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,473
<i>Now...</i>

89
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,184
<i>where to begin?</i>

90
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,520
<i>Ah, yes...</i>

91
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,692
<i>"Concerning...</i>

92
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,529
<i>Hobbits."</i>

93
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,200
<i>Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...</i>

94
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,369
<i>for many hundreds of years...</i>

95
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,497
<i>quite content to ignore
and be ignored...</i>

96
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,875
<i>by the world of the Big Folk.</i>

97
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,881
<i>Middle-Earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...</i>

98
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,218
<i>Hobbits must seem
of little importance...</i>

99
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,430
<i>being neither renowned
as great warriors...</i>

100
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,810
<i>nor counted among the very wise.</i>

101
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,192
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,946
<i>In fact, it has been remarked by some...</i>

103
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,659
<i>that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.</i>

104
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,203
<i>A rather unfair observation...</i>

105
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,082
<i>as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...</i>

106
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,210
<i>and the smoking of pipe-weed.</i>

107
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,505
<i>But where our hearts truly lie...</i>

108
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,841
<i>is in peace and quiet...</i>

109
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,677
<i>and good, tilled earth.</i>

110
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:01,057
<i>For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.</i>

111
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,607
<i>And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.</i>

112
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:14,029
<i>But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:</i>

113
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:20,493
<i>It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.</i>

114
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,876
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,994
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,550
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,893
♪ Down from the door where it began ♪

118
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,401
♪ And I must follow if I can ♪

119
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:58,490
♪ The road goes ever on and on ♪

120
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,243
♪ Down from the door where it began ♪

121
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:07,374
♪ Now far ahead the road has gone ♪

122
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,795
♪ And I must follow if I can ♪
You're late.

123
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,885
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,307
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,780
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,329
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,166
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,212
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,840
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,008
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,010
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,930
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,395
<i>And so life in the Shire goes on...</i>

134
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,648
<i>very much as it has
this past Age...</i>

135
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:19,362
<i>full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.</i>

136
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,448
<i>If it comes at all.</i>

137
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,161
<i>For things are made to endure
in the Shire...</i>

138
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,831
<i>passing from one generation
to the next.</i>

139
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:35,211
<i>There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...</i>

140
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,713
<i>in Bag End.</i>

141
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,343
<i>And there always will be.</i>

142
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,389
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,018
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,979
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,693
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

146
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,041
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,903
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,539
All right, then. Keep your secrets.
What?

149
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,468
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,750
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,400
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,088
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,590
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:09,097
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,851
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,105
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,440
Oh, really?

158
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,031
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,522
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,044
Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,939
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,611
I'm glad you're back.
So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,825
So am I.

164
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,471
Whoa, whoa.

165
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,192
No, thank you!

166
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,321
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

167
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,033
And what about very old friends?

168
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,871
Gandalf?

169
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,042
Bilbo Baggins.
My dear Gandalf!

170
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,381
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

171
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,134
You haven't aged a day.

172
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,726
Come on, come in!

173
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,354
Welcome, welcome.

174
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,066
Oh, here we are.

175
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,195
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

176
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,157
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

177
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,412
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

178
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,084
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

179
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,920
Just tea, thank you.

180
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,093
Oh!

181
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,928
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

182
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,432
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

183
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:02,937
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've
only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

184
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,441
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

185
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,611
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

186
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,241
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

187
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,286
I've just found some sponge cake.

188
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,686
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

189
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,963
Just tea, thank you.
Oh, right.

190
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,467
You don't mind if I eat, do you?
No, not at all.

191
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,578
<i>Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!</i>

192
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,221
I'm not at home!

193
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,813
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

194
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,107
<i>I know you're in there!</i>
They're after the house.

195
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,277
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

196
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,424
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

197
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,324
never giving me a moment's peace.

198
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,661
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

199
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:05,333
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

200
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,504
So you mean to go through with your plan?
Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

201
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,964
All the arrangements are made.

202
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,510
Oh, thank you.

203
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,346
Frodo suspects something.

204
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,015
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

205
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,851
not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

206
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,188
You will tell him, won't you?

207
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,149
Yes, yes.
He's very fond of you.

208
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,861
I know.

209
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,534
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

210
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,663
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

211
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,542
The woods, the fields.

212
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,044
Little rivers.

213
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,218
I am old, Gandalf.

214
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,891
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

215
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,563
I feel thin.

216
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,398
Sort of stretched...

217
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,069
like butter scraped
over too much bread.

218
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,740
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

219
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,202
And I don't expect I shall return.

220
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,583
In fact, I mean not to.

221
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,381
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

222
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,731
Ah.

223
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,276
Gandalf, my old friend...

224
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,279
this will be a night to remember.

225
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,136
Hello, hello.

226
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,474
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

227
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,102
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

228
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,275
I think I'll just have another ale.
Oh, no, you don't.

229
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,111
Go on!

230
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,998
So there I was...

231
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:55,336
at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

232
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,505
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

233
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,132
about how they were
going to cook us.

234
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:05,346
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

235
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,934
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

236
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,688
that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

237
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,191
and turned them all to stone!

238
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,864
Quickly.

239
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,827
Whoa!

240
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,037
Up they go!

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,208
No, the big one.

242
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,220
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

243
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,347
Are all these children yours?

244
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,517
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

245
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,854
Bilbo?

246
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,232
Sackville-Bagginses!

247
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,567
Quickly, hide!

248
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,579
Thank you, my boy.

249
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,499
You're a good lad, Frodo.

250
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,587
I'm very selfish, you know.

251
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,424
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

252
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,987
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

253
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,553
but it wasn't out of charity.

254
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,722
I think it was because...

255
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,224
of all my numerous relations...

256
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,020
you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

257
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,111
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

258
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,024
No.

259
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,943
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

260
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,405
The point is, Frodo...

261
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,452
you'll be all right.

262
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,957
Done!
You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

263
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,626
It is in the ground.
Outside!

264
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,294
This was your idea.

265
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,645
Bilbo.

266
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,649
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

267
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,152
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

268
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,336
That was good.
Let's get another one.

269
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:48,092
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

270
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,136
I might've known.

271
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,102
Speech, Bilbo!

272
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,312
Speech!

273
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,605
Speech!

274
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,155
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

275
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,158
Tooks and Brandybucks...

276
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,827
Grubbs, Chubbs...

277
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,078
Hornblowers...

278
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,873
Bolgers...

279
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,833
Bracegirdles...

280
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,669
and Proudfoots.
Proudfeet!

281
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,008
Today is my 111th birthday!

282
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,344
Happy birthday!

283
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:36,849
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

284
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,894
such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

285
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,564
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

286
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:48,360
and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

287
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,491
I, uh...

288
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,706
I have things to do.

289
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,215
I've put this off far too long.

290
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,014
I regret to announce this is the end!

291
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,350
I'm going now.

292
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,354
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

293
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,941
Goodbye.

294
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,310
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

295
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,897
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

296
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:12,111
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

297
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,488
It was just a bit of fun.

298
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,409
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

299
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:23,330
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
Two eyes.

300
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,208
As often as I can spare them.

301
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,587
I'm leaving everything to him.
What about this ring of yours?

302
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,132
Is that staying too?
Yes, yes.

303
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,636
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

304
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,682
No. Wait, it's...

305
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,854
here in my pocket.

306
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,737
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

307
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,867
Yet, after all, why not?

308
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,332
Why shouldn't I keep it?
I think you should leave the ring behind.

309
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,959
Is that so hard?

310
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,461
Well, no.

311
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,381
And yes.

312
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,386
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

313
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,388
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

314
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,809
There's no need to get angry.
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

315
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,062
It's mine.

316
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,815
My own.

317
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,153
My precious.
Precious?

318
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,198
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

319
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,992
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

320
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,912
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

321
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,998
You want it for yourself!
Bilbo Baggins!

322
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:52,419
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

323
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,340
I am not trying to rob you.

324
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,097
I'm trying to help you.

325
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,900
All your long years,
we've been friends.

326
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,444
Trust me as you once did.

327
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,115
Let it go.

328
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,660
You're right, Gandalf.

329
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,456
The ring must go to Frodo.

330
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,794
It's late. The road is long.

331
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,463
Yes, it is time.

332
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,301
Bilbo.
Hm?

333
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,304
The ring is still in your pocket.

334
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,600
Ah. Yes.

335
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,009
I've thought up an ending for my book:

336
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:28,682
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

337
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,311
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

338
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,813
Goodbye, Gandalf.

339
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,194
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

340
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:52,206
The road goes ever on and on

341
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,127
Until our next meeting.

342
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,200
<i>It's mine. My own.</i>

343
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,787
<i>My precious.</i>

344
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,998
<i>Riddles in the dark.</i>

345
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,625
Bilbo!

346
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,377
Bilbo!

347
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,925
<i>My precious.</i>

348
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,762
<i>Precious.</i>

349
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,515
He's gone, hasn't he?

350
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,312
He talked for so long about leaving...

351
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,274
I didn't think he'd really do it.

352
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,613
Gandalf?

353
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,582
Bilbo's ring.

354
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,293
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

355
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,588
He's left you Bag End.

356
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,760
Along with all his possessions.

357
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,805
The ring is yours now.

358
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,936
Put it somewhere out of sight.
Where are you going?

359
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,385
There are some things that I must see to.
What things?

360
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,818
Questions. Questions that need answering.
You've only just arrived.

361
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,322
I don't understand.

362
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,659
Neither do I.

363
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,290
Keep it secret.

364
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,208
Keep it safe.

365
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,371
<i>Shire!</i>

366
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,832

Baggins.

381
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:46,500
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

There's been some strange folk

00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,829
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

393
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,705
War is brewing.

394
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,209
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

395
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,045
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

396
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:36,716
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

397
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,886
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

398
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,513
And proud of it.

399
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,932
Cheers, Gaffer.
Cheers.

400
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,228
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

401
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,732
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

402
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,280
Good night, lads.
Good night.

403
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:02,951
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

404
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,537
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

405
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:10,250
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

406
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,419
Does she?

407
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,089
Good night, Sam.
Good night, Mr. Frodo.

408
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,366
Is it secret? Is it safe?

409
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,582
Ah.

410
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,377
What are you doing?

411
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,476
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

412
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,810
It's quite cool.

413
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,149
What can you see?

414
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,320
Can you see anything?

415
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,491
Nothing.

416
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,118
There's nothing.

417
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,663
Wait.

418
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,002
There are markings.

419
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,924
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

420
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,677
There are few who can.

421
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,057
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

422
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,725
Mordor!

423
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,019
In the common tongue, it says:

424
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,731
"One Ring to rule them all...

425
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,317
One Ring to find them...

426
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,695
One Ring to bring them all...

427
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,031
and in the darkness bind them."

428
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,702
This is the One Ring...

429
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:14,165
forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

430
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,378
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

431
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,715
Bilbo found it.

432
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,092
In Gollum's cave.
Yes.

433
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,888
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

434
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,475
prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

435
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:37,564
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

436
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,108
The Ring has awoken.

437
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,069
It's heard its master's call.

438
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:47,198
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

439
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,998
No, Frodo.

440
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:59,252
The spirit of Sauron endured.

441
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,758
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

442
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,260
Sauron has returned.

443
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,263
His Orcs have multiplied.

444
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,476
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

445
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:19,439
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

446
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,733
He is seeking it.

447
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,779
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

448
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,740
For the Ring yearns above all else...

449
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,327
to return to the hand
of its master.

450
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,329
They are one...

451
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,624
the Ring and the Dark Lord.

452
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,833
Frodo...

453
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,294
he must never find it.

454
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,545
All right.

455
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,175
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

456
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,053
No one knows it's here, do they?

457
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,935
Do they, Gandalf?

458
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:01,356
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

459
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,652
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

460
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,987
But the enemy found him first.

461
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,200
<i>I don't know how long
they tortured him.</i>

462
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,871
<i>But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:</i>

463
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,207
Shire!

464
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,000
Baggins!

465
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,044
Shire.

466
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,172
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

467
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,009
Who goes there?

468
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,971
Take it, Gandalf!

469
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,389
Take it!
No, Frodo.

470
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,975
You must take it!
You cannot offer me this ring!

471
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,520
I'm giving it to you!
Don't tempt me, Frodo!

472
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,232
I dare not take it.

473
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,026
Not even to keep it safe.

474
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,196
Understand, Frodo...

475
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,492
I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

476
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:05,628
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

477
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,132
But it cannot stay in the Shire!
No.

478
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,635
No, it can't.

479
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,350
What must I do?

480
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,564
You must leave. And leave quickly.
Where? Where do I go?

481
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,026
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

482
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,402
Bree.

483
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,363
What about you?
I'll be waiting for you...

484
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,033
at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

485
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,953
And the Ring will be safe there?
I don't know, Frodo.

486
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,164
I don't have any answers.

487
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:48,254
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

488
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,548
He'll know what to do.

489
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,968
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

490
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,763
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

491
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,683
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

492
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,479
I can cut across country
easily enough.

493
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,316
My dear Frodo.

494
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,653
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

495
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,781
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

496
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,325
And yet, after a hundred years...

497
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,577
they can still surprise you.

498
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,497
Get down.

499
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,263
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

500
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,934
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

501
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,520
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

502
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,606
I heard raised voices.
What did you hear? Speak!

503
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,857
Nothing important.

504
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,529
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

505
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:59,492
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

506
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,828
No?

507
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,163
Perhaps not.

508
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,835
I've thought of a better use for you.

509
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,548
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

510
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,343
Be careful, both of you.

511
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,346
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

512
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,516
Birds, beasts.

513
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,061
Is it safe?

514
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,148
Never put it on...

515
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,735
for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

516
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,403
Always remember, Frodo...

517
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,073
the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

518
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,576
It wants to be found.

519
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,410
This is it.

520
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,913
This is what?

521
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,248
If I take one more step...

522
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,628
it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

523
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,425
Come on, Sam.

524
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,644
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

525
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,981
"It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
"Going out your door.

526
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:58,611
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

527
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,949
there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

528
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,798
Sam.

529
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,428
Wood-elves.

530
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,653
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

531
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,989
To the Grey Havens.

532
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,616
They're leaving Middle-Earth.

533
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,994
Never to return.

534
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,999
I don't know why...

535
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,085
it makes me sad.

536
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:02,800
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

537
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,219
Just shut your eyes...

538
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,181
and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

539
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,310
with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

540
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,322
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

541
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,366
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

542
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,038
Me neither, Sam.

543
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,611
<i>Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.</i>

544
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,446
<i>The hour grows late.</i>

545
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,242
<i>And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...</i>

546
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,869
<i>seeking my counsel.</i>

547
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,082
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

548
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,542
My old friend.

549
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,418
Saruman.

550
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,260
You are sure of this?
Beyond any doubt.

551
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,304
So the Ring of Power has been found.

552
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,724
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

553
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,061
Under my very nose.
Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

554
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:42,191
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

555
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:47,071
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

556
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,698
Time?

557
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,243
What time do you think we have?

558
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,581
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

559
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,958
He cannot yet take physical form...

560
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,919
but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

561
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:07,633
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

562
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:14,140
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

563
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,811
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

564
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,984
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

565
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,737
The Eye of Sauron.

566
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,531
He is gathering all evil to him.

567
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,242
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

568
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,620
for an assault upon Middle-Earth.

569
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,331
You know this?

570
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,333
How?

571
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,627
I have seen it.

572
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,255
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

573
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,466
Why?

574
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,636
Why should we fear to use it?

575
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:58,184
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

576
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,604
We do not know who else
may be watching.

577
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,943
The hour is later than you think.

578
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,445
Sauron's forces are already moving.

579
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,450
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

580
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,868
The Nine?

581
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,121
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

582
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,958
disguised as riders in black.

583
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:26,128
They've reached the Shire?
They will find the Ring.

584
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,966
And kill the one who carries it.

585
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,968
Frodo!

586
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,985
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

587
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,530
There are none who can.

588
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,743
Against the power of Mordor...

589
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,579
there can be no victory.

590
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,710
We must join with him, Gandalf.

591
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,338
We must join with Sauron.

592
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,677
It would be wise, my friend.

593
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,595
Tell me...

594
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:17,847
friend...

595
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,394
when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

596
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,602
I gave you the chance...

597
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,397
of aiding me willingly...

598
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,735
but you have elected
the way of pain!

599
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,510
Mr. Frodo?

600
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,929
Frodo? Frodo!

601
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,600
I thought I'd lost you.
What are you talking about?

602
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,770
It's just something Gandalf said.
What did he say?

603
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,483
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

604
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:56,362
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

605
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,366
Frodo.

606
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,868
Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
Hello, Frodo.

607
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,453
Get off him.

608
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,455
Come on, Frodo.

609
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,499
What's the meaning of this?

610
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,709
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

611
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,339
You get back here!

612
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,675
Get out of my field!

613
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,678
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

614
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,848
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

615
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,141
And some cabbages.

616
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,227
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

617
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,481
And then the mushrooms the week before.
Yes, Pippin. My point is...

618
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,859
he's clearly overreacting.

619
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,569
Run!

620
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,585
Oh, that was close.

621
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,797
I think I've broken something.

622
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,176
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

623
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:04,013
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

624
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,432
Short cut to what?
Mushrooms!

625
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,692
That's mine.

626
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,071
That's nice, Merry.

627
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,616
Here's a nice one, Sam.

628
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,368
I think we should get off the road.

629
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,921
Get off the road!

630
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,631
Quick!

631
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,811
Be quiet!

632
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,297
What was that?

633
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,497
Anything?

634
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,666
Nothing.

635
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,669
What is going on?

636
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:45,007
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

637
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,843
Frodo?

638
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,595
Get down!

639
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,781
I have to leave the Shire.

640
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,076
Sam and I must get to Bree.

641
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,702
Right.

642
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,373
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

643
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,007
Run!

644
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,219
This way! Follow me!

645
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,807
Run!

646
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,822
Get the rope, Sam!

647
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,034
Frodo!

648
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,161
Run, Frodo!

649
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,579
Go!
Hurry!

650
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,416
Frodo, come on!

651
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,335
Come on! Faster!
Jump!

652
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:22,521
How far to the nearest crossing?
The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

653
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,620
Come on.

654
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:53,218
What do you want?
We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

655
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,558
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

656
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,687
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

657
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,232
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

658
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,819
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

659
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,530
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

660
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,533
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

661
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,869
Can't be too careful.

662
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:42,100
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

663
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,876
Excuse me.

664
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,713
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

665
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:17,970
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

666
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:22,808
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

667
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,019
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

668
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,815
Underhill, yes.
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

669
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,151
Can you tell him we've arrived?
Gandalf?

670
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,320
Gandalf.

671
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,823
Oh, yes...

672
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,158
I remember. Elderly chap.

673
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,412
Big Grey beard, pointy hat.

674
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,664
Not seen him for six months.

675
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,714
What do we do now?

676
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,180
Sam...

677
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,224
he'll be here. He'll come.

678
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,062
Get out of my way!

679
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,108
What's that?

680
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,861
This, my friend, is a pint.

681
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,696
It comes in pints?

682
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,742
I'm getting one.
You got a whole half already!

683
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,918
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

684
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,965
Excuse me.

685
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,762
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

686
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:47,351
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

687
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:52,105
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

688
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,734
Strider.

689
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,958
<i>Baggins.</i>

690
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,963
<i>Baggins.</i>

691
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:27,474
<i>Baggins. Baggins.</i>

692
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,603
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

693
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,273
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

694
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,485
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

695
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,946
and my third cousin, twice removed...

696
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,202
Pippin!
Steady on, Frodo.

697
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,192
<i>You cannot hide.</i>

698
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,323
<i>I see you.</i>

699
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,703
<i>There is no life...</i>

700
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,080
<i>in the void.</i>

701
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,749
<i>Only...</i>

702
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,168
<i>death.</i>

703
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:47,053
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

704
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:52,768
What do you want?

705
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,372
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

706
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,398
I carry nothing.
Indeed.

707
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,234
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

708
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:05,113
but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

709
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,241
Who are you?
Are you frightened?

710
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,535
Yes.

711
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:14,623
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

712
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,171
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

713
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,968
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

714
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:30,055
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

715
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,223
They're coming.

716
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,433
What are they?

717
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,729
They were once Men.

718
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,440
Great kings of Men.

719
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:06,818
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

720
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,488
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

721
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,075
One by one, falling into darkness.

722
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,745
Now they are slaves to his will.

723
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,832
They are the Nazgûl.

724
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,752
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

725
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:25,962
At all times they feel...

726
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,089
<i>the presence of the Ring...</i>

727
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,802
<i>drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.</i>

728
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,690
Where are you taking us?
Into the Wild.

729
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:57,994
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

730
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:00,997
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

731
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:05,293
and feel fouler.
He's foul enough.

732
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,713
We have no choice but to trust him.

733
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:12,342
But where is he leading us?
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

734
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,014
To the house of Elrond.
Did you hear that? Rivendell.

735
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,351
We're going to see the Elves.

736
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:47,252
Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
What about breakfast?

737
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,088
You've already had it.
We've had one, yes.

738
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,507
What about second breakfast?

739
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:59,097
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

740
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:04,519
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

741
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:08,898
He knows about them, doesn't he?
I wouldn't count on it.

742
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,947
Pippin!

743
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,967
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

744
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,841
Who is she?

745
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,136
This woman you sing of.

746
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,975
'Tis the lady of Lúthien.

747
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:31,314
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

748
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,276
What happened to her?

749
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,989
She died.

750
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,371
Get some sleep, Frodo.

751
01:08:56,632 --> 01:09:00,718
<i>The power of Isengard
is at your command...</i>

752
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:05,348
<i>Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</i>

753
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:14,482
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</i>

754
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:24,659
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

755
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,036
We have work to do.

756
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:14,250
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

757
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,461
Rip them all down.

758
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,783
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

759
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,162
We shall rest here tonight.

760
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:06,302
These are for you.
Keep them close.

761
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,013
I'm going to have a look around.

762
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,309
Stay here.

763
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:18,022
My tomato's burst.

764
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,149
Could I have some bacon?

765
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,318
Want a tomato, Sam?

766
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,364
What are you doing?!
Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

767
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,284
We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
Put it out, you fools!

768
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:33,496
Put it out!
That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

769
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,673
Go!

770
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,561
Back, you devils!

771
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,312
Frodo!

772
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,193
Frodo.
Oh, Sam.

773
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,231
Strider!

774
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:55,531
Help him, Strider.
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

775
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:01,913
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

776
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,543
Hurry!

777
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:11,714
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

778
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,758
Hold on, Frodo.

779
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,385
Gandalf!

780
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:57,380
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

781
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:02,385
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

782
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,098
Is he going to die?

783
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:12,186
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

784
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,195
They're close.
Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

785
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,863
Athelas?
Kingsfoil.

786
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,151
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

787
01:18:24,324 --> 01:18:27,451
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

788
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,970
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

789
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,912
Frodo.

790
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,681
Who is she?

791
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,100
Frodo.

792
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:36,854
She's an Elf.
He's fading.

793
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,275
He's not going to last.

794
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:44,153
We must get him to my father.

795
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,782
I've been looking for you for two days.
Where are you taking him?

796
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:54,038
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

797
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,130
What are they saying?

798
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:10,888
I do not fear them.

799
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,149
Arwen...

800
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,528
ride hard. Don't look back.

801
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:34,954
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

802
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:32,279
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

803
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,783
If you want him, come and claim him.

804
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,172
No. No!

805
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,720
Frodo, no.

806
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:40,222
Frodo, don't give in.

807
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,433
Not now.

808
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,863
What grace is given me...

809
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,365
let it pass to him.

810
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,743
Let him be spared.

811
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,412
Save him.

812
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,971
Where am I?
You are in the house of Elrond.

813
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:27,936
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

814
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,692
Gandalf!
Yes, I'm here.

815
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,405
And you're lucky to be here too.

816
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:43,077
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

817
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:47,414
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

818
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:57,508
What happened, Gandalf?

819
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:03,847
Why didn't you meet us?
I am sorry, Frodo.

820
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:10,354
I was delayed.

821
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:15,442
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

822
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:24,201
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

823
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,246
Embrace the power of the Ring...

824
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,332
or embrace your own destruction!

825
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:36,505
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

826
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:40,759
Only one who can bend it to his will.

827
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:45,514
And he does not share power.

828
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:03,240
So you have chosen death.

829
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:17,087
Gandalf? What is it?

830
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,840
Nothing, Frodo.

831
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,342
Frodo!

832
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:23,594
Frodo!

833
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:26,180
Sam.
Bless you, you're awake!

834
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:29,099
Sam has hardly left your side.

835
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,550
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

836
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:37,024
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

837
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:42,112
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

838
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:33,497
Bilbo!
Hello, Frodo, my lad.

839
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,374
Bilbo.

840
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,130
"There and Back Again:

841
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:45,133
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

842
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:51,765
This is wonderful.
I meant to go back...

843
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,894
wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

844
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,647
visit Lake-town...

845
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:02,276
see the Lonely Mountain again.

846
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:07,614
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

847
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,503
I miss the Shire.

848
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:27,050
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

849
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,971
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

850
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:37,519
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

851
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,944
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

852
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:49,406
My dear boy.

853
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:57,456
Now, what have I forgotten?
Packed already?

854
01:28:58,249 --> 01:29:00,042
No harm in being prepared.

855
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,836
I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
I do.

856
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,922
More than anything.
I did.

857
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,008
It's just...

858
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,428
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

859
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:15,265
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

860
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,769
seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

861
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:20,687
Off home.

862
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,860
You are right, Sam.

863
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,782
We did what we set out to do.

864
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,951
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

865
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,375
I am ready to go home.

866
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:44,211
His strength returns.

867
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:50,092
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

868
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,220
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

869
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:57,099
the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

870
01:29:57,308 --> 01:30:00,644
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

871
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:06,316
We can ask no more of Frodo.
Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

872
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:11,154
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

873
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,157
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

874
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:17,577
Our list of allies grows thin.

875
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:21,123
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

876
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:25,001
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

877
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:27,629
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

878
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:32,509
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

879
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:35,095
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

880
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:39,599
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

881
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:44,187
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

882
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:49,109
Gandalf...

883
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,029
the Ring cannot stay here.

884
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,719
This peril belongs
to all Middle-Earth.

885
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,680
They must decide now how to end it.

886
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,310
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

887
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,564
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

888
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:32,861
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

889
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,324
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

890
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,367
Men?

891
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:43,497
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

892
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:48,126
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

893
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:51,922
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

894
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:53,757
I was there, Gandalf.

895
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:57,260
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

896
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:06,520
<i>when Isildur took the Ring.</i>

897
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:10,607
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

898
01:32:13,152 --> 01:32:15,695
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

899
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:20,909
<i>I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...</i>

900
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,704
<i>where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

901
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:27,457
Cast it into the fire!

902
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:36,424
Destroy it!
No.

903
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,928
Isildur!

904
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:45,141
<i>It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

905
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:53,483
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

906
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:58,071
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

907
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:03,076
They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
There is one who could unite them.

908
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:06,663
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

909
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,168
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

910
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,462
He has chosen exile.

911
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,704
You are no Elf.

912
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,956
Men of the South are welcome here.

913
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:54,044
Who are you?
I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

914
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,381
Then we are here on common purpose...

915
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,216
friend.

916
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:18,318
The shards of Narsil.

917
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:26,242
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

918
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:31,414
It's still sharp.

919
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:43,385
But no more than a broken heirloom.

920
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:13,248
Why do you fear the past?

921
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:19,462
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

922
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:23,133
You are not bound to his fate.

923
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:27,637
The same blood flows in my veins.

924
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:33,226
The same weakness.

925
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,732
Your time will come.

926
01:35:38,941 --> 01:35:43,319
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

927
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:08,052
Do you remember when we first met?

928
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,539
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

929
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:43,546
forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

930
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:46,549
And to that I hold.

931
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:50,345
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

932
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:54,474
than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

933
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,694
I choose a mortal life.

934
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:12,283
You cannot give me this.
It is mine to give to whom I will...

935
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:18,039
like my heart.

936
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:37,517
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

937
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:41,646
you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

938
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:47,151
Middle-Earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

939
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,905
You will unite, or you will fall.

940
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:55,410
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

941
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,748
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

942
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:16,556
So it is true.

943
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:36,117
In a dream...

944
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,830
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

945
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,832
but in the West
a pale light lingered.

946
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:45,376
A voice was crying:

947
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:48,588
"Your doom is near at hand.

948
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,342
Isildur's Bane is found."

949
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,181
Isildur's Bane.

950
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:00,141
Boromir!

951
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:27,168
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

952
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:31,047
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

953
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,341
for the Black Speech of Mordor...

954
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,009
may yet be heard...

955
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:38,179
in every corner of the West!

956
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:41,015
The Ring is altogether evil.

957
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,850
It is a gift.

958
01:39:43,435 --> 01:39:45,520
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

959
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:48,231
Why not use this Ring?

960
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:51,192
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

961
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:55,738
kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

962
01:39:56,031 --> 01:39:58,241
are your lands kept safe.

963
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:04,372
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

964
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:08,418
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

965
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:13,089
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

966
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:16,801
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

967
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,095
This is no mere Ranger.

968
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,766
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

969
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:27,186
You owe him your allegiance.

970
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,192
Aragorn.

971
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:37,780
This is Isildur's heir?

972
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,827
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

973
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:52,628
Gondor has no king.

974
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,132
Gondor needs no king.

975
01:41:02,806 --> 01:41:06,476
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

976
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,980
You have only one choice.

977
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:13,608
The Ring must be destroyed.

978
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:21,365
What are we waiting for?

979
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,506
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

980
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:41,010
by any craft that we here possess.

981
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:45,681
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

982
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:49,685
Only there can it be unmade.

983
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:53,356
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

984
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:58,528
and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

985
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,532
One of you...

986
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:05,201
must do this.

987
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:11,833
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

988
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:16,379
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

989
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:21,342
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

990
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:25,763
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

991
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,558
It is a barren wasteland...

992
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:32,395
riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

993
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:36,399
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

994
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:40,903
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

995
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:45,575
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

996
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:48,411
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

997
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:53,249
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

998
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:58,754
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

999
01:43:00,757 --> 01:43:03,259
Never trust an Elf!

1000
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:10,266
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

1001
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,436
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1002
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:34,457
I will take it.

1003
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,961
I will take it.

1004
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:47,845
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1005
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,146
Though...

1006
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,068
I do not know the way.

1007
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:08,407
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1008
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:11,953
as long as it is yours to bear.

1009
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,165
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1010
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,251
I will.

1011
01:44:21,463 --> 01:44:23,756
You have my sword.

1012
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,677
And you have my bow.

1013
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,763
And my ax.

1014
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:40,773
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1015
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:46,445
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1016
01:44:46,905 --> 01:44:49,323
then Gondor will see it done.
Hey!

1017
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:56,706
Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
It is hardly possible to separate you...

1018
01:44:56,915 --> 01:45:01,794
even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1019
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,255
We're coming too!

1020
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:09,135
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1021
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,722
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1022
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,058
Quest.

1023
01:45:16,518 --> 01:45:17,560
Thing.

1024
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:22,064
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1025
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:25,568
Nine companions.

1026
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,238
So be it.

1027
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,575
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1028
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:35,077
Great!

1029
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:37,580
Where are we going?

1030
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:34,136
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1031
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:36,305
That you'd never escape your fate.

1032
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:40,476
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1033
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:44,814
but only you have the power
to wield it.

1034
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:48,317
I do not want that power.

1035
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:51,153
I have never wanted it.

1036
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:55,116
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1037
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:01,831
My old sword! Sting.

1038
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,165
Here, take it. Take it.

1039
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:12,633
It's so light.
Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1040
01:47:13,343 --> 01:47:17,429
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1041
01:47:17,639 --> 01:47:22,184
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1042
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:24,854
Here's a pretty thing.

1043
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:26,564
Mithril.

1044
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:31,735
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1045
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:35,197
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1046
01:47:38,743 --> 01:47:40,202
Oh!

1047
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:45,291
My old ring.

1048
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:50,462
I should very much like...

1049
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:54,717
to hold it again, one last time.

1050
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:15,738
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1051
01:48:16,072 --> 01:48:20,201
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1052
01:48:24,706 --> 01:48:27,750
I'm sorry for everything.

1053
01:48:42,807 --> 01:48:46,977
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1054
01:48:48,313 --> 01:48:50,940
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1055
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:54,276
nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1056
01:48:57,739 --> 01:49:00,282
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1057
01:49:00,742 --> 01:49:04,662
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1058
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:07,790
and all Free Folk go with you.

1059
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:14,964
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1060
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,901
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1061
01:49:36,444 --> 01:49:38,279
Left.

1062
01:50:57,776 --> 01:51:02,196
<i>We must hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</i>

1063
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:06,158
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.</i>

1064
01:51:06,368 --> 01:51:09,912
<i>From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.</i>

1065
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,916
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1066
01:51:15,752 --> 01:51:16,794
Move your feet.

1067
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:18,522
You look good, Pippin.
Thanks.

1068
01:51:18,546 --> 01:51:19,922
Faster!

1069
01:51:21,299 --> 01:51:25,094
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1070
01:51:25,303 --> 01:51:28,055
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1071
01:51:28,556 --> 01:51:31,600
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1072
01:51:32,268 --> 01:51:36,105
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1073
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:41,819
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1074
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,121
Sorry!

1075
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:54,456
Get him!

1076
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:58,252
For the Shire!
Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1077
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:01,130
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1078
01:52:04,926 --> 01:52:06,646
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1079
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,638
What is that?
Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1080
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:12,599
It's moving fast.

1081
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,977
Against the wind.

1082
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:17,896
Crebain from Dunland!
Hide!

1083
01:52:18,106 --> 01:52:20,816
Hurry!
Take cover!

1084
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:55,976
Spies of Saruman.

1085
01:52:56,728 --> 01:53:00,022
The passage south is being watched.

1086
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:04,526
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1087
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:18,874
Frodo!

1088
01:53:37,852 --> 01:53:40,103
Boromir.

1089
01:53:40,355 --> 01:53:44,566
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1090
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:47,903
over so small a thing.

1091
01:53:51,115 --> 01:53:53,075
Such a little thing.

1092
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:54,743
Boromir!

1093
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:58,080
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1094
01:54:07,882 --> 01:54:09,925
As you wish.

1095
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:12,636
I care not.

1096
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:52,759
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1097
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:57,556
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1098
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:01,810
If the mountain defeats you...

1099
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:06,481
will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1100
01:55:18,828 --> 01:55:21,705
There is a fell voice on the air.

1101
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:24,333
It's Saruman!

1102
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:37,888
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1103
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,973
No!

1104
01:56:46,416 --> 01:56:48,250
We must get off the mountain!

1105
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:53,088
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1106
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:56,591
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1107
01:56:56,759 --> 01:57:00,512
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1108
01:57:00,763 --> 01:57:03,598
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1109
01:57:05,435 --> 01:57:09,271
<i>Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.</i>

1110
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:14,943
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1111
01:57:15,778 --> 01:57:20,657
<i>You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:</i>

1112
01:57:21,951 --> 01:57:25,454
Shadow and flame.

1113
01:57:28,791 --> 01:57:31,460
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1114
01:57:36,174 --> 01:57:38,300
We cannot stay here!

1115
01:57:38,468 --> 01:57:41,303
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1116
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:43,180
Frodo?

1117
01:57:46,184 --> 01:57:49,060
We will go through the mines.

1118
01:57:49,812 --> 01:57:51,688
So be it.

1119
01:57:58,362 --> 01:58:02,324
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1120
01:58:05,828 --> 01:58:08,038
How is your shoulder?

1121
01:58:08,247 --> 01:58:11,500
Better than it was.
And the Ring?

1122
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:15,545
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1123
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:18,965
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1124
01:58:19,383 --> 01:58:23,303
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1125
01:58:23,471 --> 01:58:26,056
And, I fear, from within.

1126
01:58:28,684 --> 01:58:32,854
Who then do I trust?
You must trust yourself.

1127
01:58:33,022 --> 01:58:35,899
Trust your own strengths.

1128
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:38,652
What do you mean?
There are many powers in this world...

1129
01:58:38,861 --> 01:58:40,904
for good or for evil.

1130
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:43,365
Some are greater than I am.

1131
01:58:43,908 --> 01:58:47,536
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1132
01:58:48,913 --> 01:58:50,288
The walls...

1133
01:58:50,998 --> 01:58:53,083
of Moria.

1134
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:01,800
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1135
01:59:02,009 --> 01:59:06,429
Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1136
01:59:06,806 --> 01:59:09,307
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1137
01:59:17,316 --> 01:59:20,610
Well, let's see.

1138
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,195
Ithildin.

1139
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:26,199
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1140
01:59:40,256 --> 01:59:44,342
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1141
01:59:44,927 --> 01:59:49,556
Speak, friend, and enter."
What do you suppose that means?

1142
01:59:49,765 --> 01:59:54,561
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1143
02:00:18,294 --> 02:00:19,461
Nothing's happening.

1144
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:30,680
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1145
02:00:31,015 --> 02:00:33,808
Men and Orcs.

1146
02:00:34,101 --> 02:00:35,341
What are you going to do, then?

1147
02:00:35,519 --> 02:00:37,771
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1148
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:39,981
And if that does not shatter them...

1149
02:00:40,191 --> 02:00:42,901
and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1150
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:46,529
I will try to find the opening words.

1151
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:01,920
Mines are no place for a pony.

1152
02:01:02,129 --> 02:01:06,216
Even one so brave as Bill.
Bye-bye, Bill.

1153
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:10,178
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1154
02:01:10,721 --> 02:01:14,265
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1155
02:01:21,065 --> 02:01:23,650
Do not disturb the water.

1156
02:01:23,859 --> 02:01:25,735
Oh, it's useless.

1157
02:01:38,416 --> 02:01:40,583
It's a riddle.

1158
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:46,464
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1159
02:01:46,841 --> 02:01:49,759
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1160
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:52,554
Mellon.

1161
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:15,452
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1162
02:02:15,911 --> 02:02:21,624
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1163
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:26,212
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1164
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:28,965
And they call it a mine.

1165
02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:31,134
A mine!

1166
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:35,513
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1167
02:02:39,769 --> 02:02:41,227
No.

1168
02:02:41,645 --> 02:02:43,229
No...

1169
02:02:44,482 --> 02:02:46,149
No!

1170
02:02:48,778 --> 02:02:50,320
Goblins.

1171
02:02:54,241 --> 02:02:58,536
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1172
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:02,165
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1173
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:07,337
Frodo!
Help!

1174
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:09,172
Strider!

1175
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:12,133
Help!
Get off him!

1176
02:03:12,301 --> 02:03:13,343
Aragorn!

1177
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:24,813
Frodo!

1178
02:03:25,981 --> 02:03:27,565
Strider!

1179
02:03:51,173 --> 02:03:52,215
Into the mines!

1180
02:03:52,383 --> 02:03:55,593
Legolas!
Into the cave!

1181
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:01,683
Run!

1182
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:22,120
We now have but one choice.

1183
02:04:22,329 --> 02:04:27,208
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1184
02:04:27,459 --> 02:04:29,419
Be on your guard.

1185
02:04:29,628 --> 02:04:33,089
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1186
02:04:33,257 --> 02:04:36,801
in the deep places of the world.

1187
02:04:44,768 --> 02:04:48,730
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1188
02:04:48,898 --> 02:04:52,734
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1189
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:42,242
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1190
02:05:42,409 --> 02:05:44,827
or jewels...

1191
02:05:44,995 --> 02:05:48,039
but mithril.

1192
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:11,312
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1193
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:15,483
Oh, that was a kingly gift.
Yes.

1194
02:06:15,651 --> 02:06:17,568
I never told him...

1195
02:06:17,736 --> 02:06:22,699
but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1196
02:06:35,045 --> 02:06:36,754
Pippin.

1197
02:06:57,443 --> 02:07:00,069
I have no memory of this place.

1198
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:03,656
Are we lost?
No.

1199
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:06,367
I think we are.
Gandalf's thinking.

1200
02:07:06,535 --> 02:07:07,994
Merry?
What?

1201
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:10,246
I'm hungry.

1202
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:26,012
There's something down there.
It's Gollum.

1203
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:30,350
Gollum?
He's been following us for three days.

1204
02:07:30,559 --> 02:07:34,729
He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
Escaped...

1205
02:07:35,397 --> 02:07:37,065
or was set loose.

1206
02:07:37,566 --> 02:07:41,235
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1207
02:07:43,864 --> 02:07:46,574
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1208
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:52,538
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1209
02:07:52,706 --> 02:07:57,585
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1210
02:07:57,753 --> 02:08:03,716
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1211
02:08:04,593 --> 02:08:07,428
Before it drove him mad.

1212
02:08:07,721 --> 02:08:10,598
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1213
02:08:10,766 --> 02:08:11,974
Pity?

1214
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,937
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1215
02:08:16,855 --> 02:08:22,068
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1216
02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:25,947
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1217
02:08:28,409 --> 02:08:32,370
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1218
02:08:32,579 --> 02:08:35,456
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1219
02:08:36,083 --> 02:08:41,963
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1220
02:08:42,798 --> 02:08:45,633
before this is over.

1221
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:50,972
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1222
02:08:57,646 --> 02:09:00,982
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1223
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:04,485
I wish none of this had happened.

1224
02:09:04,653 --> 02:09:09,699
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1225
02:09:10,492 --> 02:09:15,997
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1226
02:09:17,499 --> 02:09:21,502
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1227
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:24,338
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1228
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:29,177
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1229
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:32,513
And that is an encouraging thought.

1230
02:09:35,476 --> 02:09:36,642
Ah!

1231
02:09:37,436 --> 02:09:39,353
It's that way.

1232
02:09:39,521 --> 02:09:41,856
He's remembered.
No.

1233
02:09:42,024 --> 02:09:45,860
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1234
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:51,240
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1235
02:10:06,048 --> 02:10:10,218
Let me risk a little more light.

1236
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,974
Behold...

1237
02:10:17,392 --> 02:10:22,605
the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1238
02:10:25,067 --> 02:10:28,528
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1239
02:10:53,428 --> 02:10:55,137
Gimli!

1240
02:11:00,936 --> 02:11:02,395
No.

1241
02:11:02,604 --> 02:11:04,230
No!

1242
02:11:06,775 --> 02:11:09,944
Oh, no.

1243
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:13,072
No.

1244
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:22,331
"Here lies Balin...

1245
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:24,792
son of Fundin...

1246
02:11:25,127 --> 02:11:27,753
Lord of Moria."

1247
02:11:28,797 --> 02:11:30,464
He is dead, then.

1248
02:11:32,634 --> 02:11:33,843
It's as I feared.

1249
02:11:52,154 --> 02:11:55,072
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1250
02:11:55,282 --> 02:11:59,994
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1251
02:12:01,079 --> 02:12:03,664
We have barred the gates...

1252
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:06,834
but cannot hold them for long.

1253
02:12:07,002 --> 02:12:09,837
The ground shakes.

1254
02:12:10,213 --> 02:12:11,839
Drums...

1255
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:15,593
drums in the deep.

1256
02:12:19,139 --> 02:12:21,182
We cannot get out.

1257
02:12:23,185 --> 02:12:27,021
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1258
02:12:28,690 --> 02:12:31,233
We cannot get out.

1259
02:12:34,237 --> 02:12:36,197
They are coming."

1260
02:13:19,241 --> 02:13:21,075
Fool of a Took!

1261
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:25,246
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1262
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:52,815
Frodo!

1263
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:56,610
Orcs.

1264
02:14:03,618 --> 02:14:05,619
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1265
02:14:12,919 --> 02:14:14,712
They have a cave-troll.

1266
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:31,645
Let them come!

1267
02:14:32,147 --> 02:14:35,733
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1268
02:16:54,623 --> 02:16:57,374
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1269
02:17:02,130 --> 02:17:03,797
Frodo!

1270
02:17:37,332 --> 02:17:39,166
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1271
02:17:40,168 --> 02:17:42,044
Frodo!

1272
02:18:27,215 --> 02:18:29,091
Frodo!

1273
02:18:31,886 --> 02:18:33,345
Frodo!

1274
02:19:29,319 --> 02:19:30,611
Oh, no.

1275
02:19:39,037 --> 02:19:40,913
He's alive.

1276
02:19:43,333 --> 02:19:46,335
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1277
02:19:46,628 --> 02:19:48,837
You should be dead.

1278
02:19:49,047 --> 02:19:51,548
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1279
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:56,553
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1280
02:20:02,352 --> 02:20:03,477
Mithril.

1281
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:08,857
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1282
02:20:14,864 --> 02:20:16,824
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1283
02:20:31,798 --> 02:20:33,382
This way!

1284
02:21:43,786 --> 02:21:46,788
What is this new devilry?

1285
02:22:02,889 --> 02:22:05,682
A Balrog.

1286
02:22:05,975 --> 02:22:09,102
A demon of the ancient world.

1287
02:22:11,314 --> 02:22:13,774
This foe is beyond any of you.

1288
02:22:14,943 --> 02:22:16,485
Run!

1289
02:22:23,826 --> 02:22:25,327
Quickly!

1290
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:43,220
Gandalf.

1291
02:22:43,846 --> 02:22:45,472
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1292
02:22:46,849 --> 02:22:49,351
The bridge is near.

1293
02:22:51,437 --> 02:22:55,524
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1294
02:23:24,679 --> 02:23:26,388
Gandalf!

1295
02:23:44,699 --> 02:23:45,907
Merry! Pippin!

1296
02:23:57,045 --> 02:23:58,545
Sam!

1297
02:24:01,299 --> 02:24:04,551
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1298
02:24:07,555 --> 02:24:09,014
Not the beard!

1299
02:24:22,236 --> 02:24:24,112
Steady.

1300
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:27,908
Hold on!

1301
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:50,138
Hang on!

1302
02:25:00,942 --> 02:25:02,651
Lean forward!

1303
02:25:05,613 --> 02:25:06,655
Steady.

1304
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:09,157
Come on!

1305
02:25:09,409 --> 02:25:10,909
Now!

1306
02:25:28,136 --> 02:25:29,928
Over the bridge!

1307
02:25:30,138 --> 02:25:31,680
Fly!

1308
02:26:16,350 --> 02:26:18,393
You cannot pass!

1309
02:26:18,561 --> 02:26:20,187
Gandalf!

1310
02:26:24,442 --> 02:26:29,321
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1311
02:26:30,323 --> 02:26:34,075
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1312
02:26:44,086 --> 02:26:46,046
Go back to the Shadow.

1313
02:26:53,888 --> 02:26:58,350
You shall not pass!

1314
02:27:25,503 --> 02:27:29,381
No! No!
Gandalf!

1315
02:27:37,056 --> 02:27:39,516
Fly, you fools!

1316
02:27:43,646 --> 02:27:45,814
No!

1317
02:27:51,946 --> 02:27:54,114
Aragorn!

1318
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:54,215
Legolas, get them up.

1319
02:28:58,346 --> 02:29:00,180
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1320
02:29:00,348 --> 02:29:03,975
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1321
02:29:04,185 --> 02:29:07,520
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1322
02:29:08,397 --> 02:29:11,691
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1323
02:29:13,194 --> 02:29:15,403
On your feet, Sam.

1324
02:29:15,738 --> 02:29:17,238
Frodo?

1325
02:29:19,325 --> 02:29:21,034
Frodo!

1326
02:30:13,546 --> 02:30:16,089
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1327
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,927
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1328
02:30:21,178 --> 02:30:23,722
An Elf-witch...

1329
02:30:24,265 --> 02:30:27,100
of terrible power.

1330
02:30:27,685 --> 02:30:29,894
All who look upon her...

1331
02:30:30,104 --> 02:30:31,896
fall under her spell.

1332
02:30:32,106 --> 02:30:33,398
<i>Frodo!</i>

1333
02:30:35,651 --> 02:30:37,694
And are never seen again.

1334
02:30:37,903 --> 02:30:42,407
<i>Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1335
02:30:42,616 --> 02:30:46,286
<i>You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.</i>

1336
02:30:46,495 --> 02:30:48,288
Mr. Frodo?

1337
02:30:53,586 --> 02:30:59,132
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1338
02:30:59,341 --> 02:31:03,928
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1339
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:16,149
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1340
02:31:34,335 --> 02:31:36,628
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1341
02:31:36,796 --> 02:31:38,671
Speak words we can all understand!

1342
02:31:38,839 --> 02:31:43,468
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1343
02:31:43,761 --> 02:31:46,262
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1344
02:31:53,187 --> 02:31:55,146
That was not so courteous.

1345
02:32:01,695 --> 02:32:05,698
You bring great evil with you.

1346
02:32:07,493 --> 02:32:09,702
You can go no further.

1347
02:32:46,949 --> 02:32:49,576
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1348
02:32:50,744 --> 02:32:52,620
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1349
02:32:54,123 --> 02:32:57,458
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1350
02:32:58,335 --> 02:33:01,421
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1351
02:33:04,425 --> 02:33:06,426
You will follow me.

1352
02:33:18,147 --> 02:33:20,106
Caras Galadhon.

1353
02:33:20,774 --> 02:33:23,735
The heart of Elvendom on Earth.

1354
02:33:23,903 --> 02:33:29,574
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1355
02:34:48,570 --> 02:34:51,698
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1356
02:34:52,366 --> 02:34:57,537
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1357
02:34:59,248 --> 02:35:03,710
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1358
02:35:03,961 --> 02:35:05,753
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1359
02:35:05,963 --> 02:35:09,048
For I much desire to speak with him.

1360
02:35:09,216 --> 02:35:12,051
I can no longer see him from afar.

1361
02:35:12,886 --> 02:35:18,057
Gandalf the Grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1362
02:35:18,350 --> 02:35:20,768
He has fallen into Shadow.

1363
02:35:25,482 --> 02:35:29,986
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1364
02:35:31,613 --> 02:35:35,366
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1365
02:35:36,076 --> 02:35:39,412
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1366
02:35:41,582 --> 02:35:44,792
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1367
02:35:45,419 --> 02:35:48,755
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1368
02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:57,805
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1369
02:35:58,098 --> 02:36:00,433
Gimli, son of Glóin.

1370
02:36:01,435 --> 02:36:04,937
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1371
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:09,108
and in all lands...

1372
02:36:09,276 --> 02:36:12,779
love is now mingled with grief.

1373
02:36:25,417 --> 02:36:28,127
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1374
02:36:28,629 --> 02:36:31,631
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1375
02:36:34,635 --> 02:36:37,929
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1376
02:36:38,097 --> 02:36:41,140
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1377
02:36:41,934 --> 02:36:44,769
to the ruin of all.

1378
02:36:49,108 --> 02:36:54,946
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1379
02:36:56,490 --> 02:37:01,160
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1380
02:37:01,662 --> 02:37:05,331
for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1381
02:37:07,584 --> 02:37:09,669
Tonight, you will sleep...

1382
02:37:09,837 --> 02:37:13,297
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1383
02:37:14,842 --> 02:37:16,676
<i>one who has seen the Eye!</i>

1384
02:37:31,316 --> 02:37:33,860
A lament for Gandalf.

1385
02:37:41,160 --> 02:37:42,702
What do they say about him?

1386
02:37:42,911 --> 02:37:45,538
I have not the heart to tell you.

1387
02:37:48,333 --> 02:37:50,543
For me, the grief is still too near.

1388
02:37:53,547 --> 02:37:56,382
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1389
02:37:56,550 --> 02:37:59,552
There should be a verse about them.

1390
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:05,141
The finest rockets ever seen

1391
02:38:06,226 --> 02:38:09,061
They burst in stars of blue and green

1392
02:38:10,022 --> 02:38:13,441
Or after thunder, silver showers

1393
02:38:15,903 --> 02:38:18,738
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1394
02:38:18,906 --> 02:38:22,783
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1395
02:38:33,587 --> 02:38:36,255
Take some rest.

1396
02:38:36,465 --> 02:38:39,175
These borders are well-protected.

1397
02:38:39,384 --> 02:38:41,928
I will find no rest here.

1398
02:38:44,765 --> 02:38:47,767
I heard her voice inside my head.

1399
02:38:47,976 --> 02:38:51,729
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1400
02:38:51,939 --> 02:38:57,401
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1401
02:38:58,779 --> 02:39:01,614
But I cannot see it.

1402
02:39:02,950 --> 02:39:05,451
It is long since we had any hope.

1403
02:39:15,629 --> 02:39:17,755
My father is a noble man.

1404
02:39:18,507 --> 02:39:20,758
But his rule is failing...

1405
02:39:21,093 --> 02:39:26,472
and our people lose faith.

1406
02:39:27,933 --> 02:39:31,477
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1407
02:39:31,645 --> 02:39:35,147
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1408
02:39:37,985 --> 02:39:40,987
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1409
02:39:41,655 --> 02:39:43,656
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1410
02:39:43,824 --> 02:39:47,660
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1411
02:39:48,328 --> 02:39:51,831
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1412
02:39:54,751 --> 02:39:56,711
Have you ever been called home...

1413
02:39:56,878 --> 02:40:00,840
by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1414
02:40:01,466 --> 02:40:04,677
I have seen the White City...

1415
02:40:05,012 --> 02:40:06,512
long ago.

1416
02:40:07,514 --> 02:40:12,476
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1417
02:40:13,395 --> 02:40:16,355
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1418
02:40:16,815 --> 02:40:20,151
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1419
02:41:27,344 --> 02:41:29,887
Will you look into the mirror?

1420
02:41:30,055 --> 02:41:31,597
What will I see?

1421
02:41:34,559 --> 02:41:36,894
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1422
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:39,605
For the mirror...

1423
02:41:39,856 --> 02:41:42,400
shows many things.

1424
02:41:45,404 --> 02:41:47,780
Things that were...

1425
02:41:47,989 --> 02:41:50,574
things that are...

1426
02:41:51,368 --> 02:41:53,285
and some things...

1427
02:41:56,873 --> 02:42:00,167
that have not yet come to pass.

1428
02:43:22,709 --> 02:43:25,544
I know what it is you saw.

1429
02:43:28,006 --> 02:43:30,508
For it is also in my mind.

1430
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:36,347
<i>It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.</i>

1431
02:43:38,725 --> 02:43:43,562
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1432
02:43:44,231 --> 02:43:47,525
<i>He will try to take the Ring.</i>

1433
02:43:47,734 --> 02:43:49,735
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1434
02:43:50,737 --> 02:43:55,407
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1435
02:43:56,910 --> 02:43:59,370
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1436
02:43:59,746 --> 02:44:02,790
<i>I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1437
02:44:03,875 --> 02:44:06,043
You offer it to me freely.

1438
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:14,552
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1439
02:44:20,934 --> 02:44:24,228
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1440
02:44:24,646 --> 02:44:28,440
not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1441
02:44:29,109 --> 02:44:32,111
Treacherous as the sea!

1442
02:44:32,612 --> 02:44:37,575
Stronger than the foundations
of the Earth!

1443
02:44:38,034 --> 02:44:40,411
All shall love me...

1444
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:43,455
and despair.

1445
02:44:57,554 --> 02:45:01,849
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1446
02:45:02,142 --> 02:45:04,602
and go into the West...

1447
02:45:04,811 --> 02:45:09,273
and remain Galadriel.
I cannot do this alone.

1448
02:45:12,861 --> 02:45:16,989
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1449
02:45:17,949 --> 02:45:19,450
is to be alone.

1450
02:45:22,787 --> 02:45:25,497
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1451
02:45:25,707 --> 02:45:27,333
And I am its keeper.

1452
02:45:30,503 --> 02:45:34,173
This task was appointed to you.

1453
02:45:35,175 --> 02:45:38,093
And if you do not find a way...

1454
02:45:39,304 --> 02:45:41,305
no one will.

1455
02:45:41,681 --> 02:45:44,850
Then I know what I must do.

1456
02:45:45,518 --> 02:45:46,685
It's just...

1457
02:45:49,981 --> 02:45:52,191
I'm afraid to do it.

1458
02:45:55,695 --> 02:46:00,866
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1459
02:46:06,206 --> 02:46:11,919
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1460
02:46:12,712 --> 02:46:16,048
They were Elves once.

1461
02:46:17,217 --> 02:46:20,552
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1462
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:23,889
tortured and mutilated.

1463
02:46:24,224 --> 02:46:29,561
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1464
02:46:29,854 --> 02:46:31,689
And now...

1465
02:46:33,149 --> 02:46:35,025
perfected.

1466
02:46:35,735 --> 02:46:38,904
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1467
02:46:40,865 --> 02:46:43,200
whom do you serve?

1468
02:46:43,410 --> 02:46:45,911
Saruman!

1469
02:47:06,766 --> 02:47:10,227
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1470
02:47:10,437 --> 02:47:13,313
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1471
02:47:13,565 --> 02:47:16,442
You will taste Man-flesh!

1472
02:47:21,573 --> 02:47:25,284
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1473
02:47:25,452 --> 02:47:29,621
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1474
02:47:31,458 --> 02:47:32,750
Kill the others.

1475
02:47:51,936 --> 02:47:57,357
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1476
02:47:58,485 --> 02:48:02,321
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1477
02:48:09,496 --> 02:48:11,038
Lembas.

1478
02:48:11,289 --> 02:48:12,873
Elvish waybread.

1479
02:48:15,376 --> 02:48:18,378
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1480
02:48:24,844 --> 02:48:26,845
How many did you eat?

1481
02:48:27,013 --> 02:48:28,680
Four.

1482
02:48:34,479 --> 02:48:37,079
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1483
02:48:37,273 --> 02:48:41,360
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

1484
02:48:41,528 --> 02:48:44,029
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1485
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:48,075
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1486
02:48:48,284 --> 02:48:53,372
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1487
02:49:06,052 --> 02:49:07,446
By river you have the chance...

1488
02:49:07,470 --> 02:49:10,681
of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1489
02:49:27,949 --> 02:49:32,744
<i>My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

1490
02:49:33,037 --> 02:49:36,540
<i>Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.</i>

1491
02:49:41,921 --> 02:49:44,381
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

1492
02:49:44,549 --> 02:49:47,759
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

1493
02:49:47,927 --> 02:49:50,971
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

1494
02:49:51,139 --> 02:49:54,433
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1495
02:49:56,352 --> 02:49:58,312
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1496
02:49:58,479 --> 02:50:01,064
<i>Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

1497
02:50:01,232 --> 02:50:03,358
Thank you, my lady.

1498
02:50:05,153 --> 02:50:08,488
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1499
02:50:14,954 --> 02:50:17,956
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1500
02:50:18,124 --> 02:50:20,292
Nothing.

1501
02:50:20,919 --> 02:50:24,254
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1502
02:50:24,881 --> 02:50:30,093
for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1503
02:50:37,143 --> 02:50:38,685
Actually...

1504
02:50:38,895 --> 02:50:40,479
There was one thing.

1505
02:50:41,314 --> 02:50:43,982
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1506
02:50:44,150 --> 02:50:46,985
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

1507
02:50:49,489 --> 02:50:51,657
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1508
02:50:51,824 --> 02:50:55,410
<i>than the gift you already bear.</i>

1509
02:51:21,062 --> 02:51:24,147
That choice is yet before her.

1510
02:51:24,732 --> 02:51:27,651
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1511
02:51:27,986 --> 02:51:33,824
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1512
02:51:33,992 --> 02:51:38,328
or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1513
02:52:05,898 --> 02:52:09,067
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1514
02:52:09,235 --> 02:52:12,696
<i>I give you the light of Eärendil...</i>

1515
02:52:13,406 --> 02:52:15,741
<i>our most beloved star.</i>

1516
02:52:24,917 --> 02:52:29,296
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...</i>

1517
02:52:29,547 --> 02:52:33,633
<i>when all other lights go out.</i>

1518
02:52:42,435 --> 02:52:45,604
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1519
02:52:46,272 --> 02:52:50,567
having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1520
02:52:51,277 --> 02:52:54,613
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1521
02:52:54,906 --> 02:52:56,823
What was her gift?

1522
02:52:57,033 --> 02:53:01,953
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1523
02:53:02,747 --> 02:53:05,624
She gave me three.

1524
02:54:47,768 --> 02:54:51,229
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1525
02:54:54,942 --> 02:54:58,069
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1526
02:54:58,279 --> 02:55:01,448
But he's too clever a waterman.

1527
02:55:02,283 --> 02:55:05,577
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1528
02:55:05,745 --> 02:55:08,038
it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1529
02:55:08,206 --> 02:55:10,248
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1530
02:55:10,416 --> 02:55:13,543
No, Sam.
You haven't eaten anything all day.

1531
02:55:13,711 --> 02:55:16,796
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1532
02:55:17,757 --> 02:55:20,759
Mr. Frodo...
I'm all right.

1533
02:55:20,927 --> 02:55:22,093
But you're not.

1534
02:55:22,386 --> 02:55:24,888
I'm here to help you.

1535
02:55:25,056 --> 02:55:26,765
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1536
02:55:32,730 --> 02:55:35,440
You can't help me, Sam.

1537
02:55:37,610 --> 02:55:39,319
Not this time.

1538
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:44,324
Get some sleep.

1539
02:55:50,665 --> 02:55:52,791
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1540
02:55:53,292 --> 02:55:56,086
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1541
02:55:56,754 --> 02:55:58,964
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1542
02:55:59,298 --> 02:56:02,217
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1543
02:56:02,635 --> 02:56:04,636
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1544
02:56:06,514 --> 02:56:09,349
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1545
02:56:09,517 --> 02:56:12,519
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1546
02:56:12,728 --> 02:56:16,022
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1547
02:56:16,274 --> 02:56:18,483
But you will not see that.

1548
02:56:18,818 --> 02:56:20,235
You are afraid!

1549
02:56:20,486 --> 02:56:23,029
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1550
02:56:23,322 --> 02:56:26,783
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1551
02:56:29,161 --> 02:56:33,540
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1552
02:56:45,386 --> 02:56:46,761
Frodo.

1553
02:56:48,639 --> 02:56:50,140
The Argonath.

1554
02:56:53,561 --> 02:56:57,314
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1555
02:56:58,024 --> 02:56:59,983
My kin.

1556
02:58:18,938 --> 02:58:21,147
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1557
02:58:21,399 --> 02:58:23,942
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1558
02:58:24,151 --> 02:58:27,612
We approach Mordor from the North.
Oh, yes?

1559
02:58:28,072 --> 02:58:31,908
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1560
02:58:32,076 --> 02:58:35,286
an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1561
02:58:35,496 --> 02:58:38,623
And after that, it gets even better.

1562
02:58:38,999 --> 02:58:43,962
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1563
02:58:44,130 --> 02:58:45,505
That is our road.

1564
02:58:47,091 --> 02:58:50,301
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1565
02:58:50,511 --> 02:58:52,262
Recover my...

1566
02:58:55,266 --> 02:58:57,267
We should leave now.
No.

1567
02:58:57,435 --> 02:59:01,896
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1568
02:59:02,106 --> 02:59:05,525
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1569
02:59:05,776 --> 02:59:09,779
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1570
02:59:10,281 --> 02:59:14,451
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1571
02:59:16,454 --> 02:59:21,416
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1572
02:59:21,917 --> 02:59:23,626
Where's Frodo?

1573
02:59:49,236 --> 02:59:51,154
None of us should wander alone.

1574
02:59:52,531 --> 02:59:54,657
You, least of all.

1575
02:59:54,867 --> 02:59:57,327
So much depends on you.

1576
02:59:58,370 --> 03:00:00,330
Frodo?

1577
03:00:07,463 --> 03:00:10,006
I know why you seek solitude.

1578
03:00:10,716 --> 03:00:14,177
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1579
03:00:14,970 --> 03:00:18,014
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1580
03:00:19,558 --> 03:00:22,227
There are other ways, Frodo.

1581
03:00:22,478 --> 03:00:26,272
Other paths that we might take.
I know what you would say.

1582
03:00:26,524 --> 03:00:30,276
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1583
03:00:30,528 --> 03:00:33,571
Warning? Against what?

1584
03:00:33,781 --> 03:00:35,907
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1585
03:00:36,116 --> 03:00:39,744
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1586
03:00:39,995 --> 03:00:43,748
don't you see that is madness?
There is no other way.

1587
03:00:45,543 --> 03:00:48,878
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1588
03:00:50,422 --> 03:00:52,507
If you would but lend me the Ring.
No.

1589
03:00:53,717 --> 03:00:57,387
Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
You are not yourself.

1590
03:00:59,223 --> 03:01:02,559
What chance do you think you have?

1591
03:01:02,726 --> 03:01:07,397
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1592
03:01:07,606 --> 03:01:11,317
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1593
03:01:13,445 --> 03:01:15,572
You fool!

1594
03:01:15,739 --> 03:01:19,742
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1595
03:01:19,910 --> 03:01:22,745
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1596
03:01:22,913 --> 03:01:24,247
Give it to me!
No!

1597
03:01:24,415 --> 03:01:26,249
Give it to me!
No.

1598
03:01:33,924 --> 03:01:35,925
I see your mind.

1599
03:01:36,135 --> 03:01:39,095
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1600
03:01:39,305 --> 03:01:41,180
You will betray us!

1601
03:01:41,432 --> 03:01:44,601
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1602
03:01:45,060 --> 03:01:48,688
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1603
03:01:55,779 --> 03:01:57,280
Frodo?

1604
03:02:01,619 --> 03:02:03,161
Frodo.

1605
03:02:07,124 --> 03:02:09,125
What have I done?

1606
03:02:09,335 --> 03:02:11,085
Please, Frodo.

1607
03:02:11,295 --> 03:02:13,963
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1608
03:02:14,173 --> 03:02:16,007
Frodo!

1609
03:03:02,513 --> 03:03:03,930
Frodo?

1610
03:03:05,182 --> 03:03:08,267
It has taken Boromir.
Where is the Ring?

1611
03:03:08,519 --> 03:03:10,269
Stay away!

1612
03:03:10,688 --> 03:03:12,271
Frodo!

1613
03:03:14,525 --> 03:03:18,361
I swore to protect you.
Can you protect me from yourself?

1614
03:03:28,038 --> 03:03:30,540
Would you destroy it?

1615
03:03:35,546 --> 03:03:37,463
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1616
03:03:40,884 --> 03:03:43,219
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1617
03:03:45,055 --> 03:03:46,889
<i>Elessar.</i>

1618
03:03:54,565 --> 03:03:57,900
I would have gone with you to the end.

1619
03:03:58,569 --> 03:04:01,404
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1620
03:04:04,742 --> 03:04:05,908
I know.

1621
03:04:08,412 --> 03:04:13,833
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1622
03:04:17,588 --> 03:04:19,297
Go, Frodo!

1623
03:04:22,301 --> 03:04:23,801
Run.

1624
03:04:24,094 --> 03:04:25,762
Run!

1625
03:04:50,287 --> 03:04:51,954
Mr. Frodo!

1626
03:05:01,256 --> 03:05:03,007
Find the halfling!

1627
03:05:04,635 --> 03:05:07,178
Find the halfling!

1628
03:05:10,641 --> 03:05:12,308
Elendil!

1629
03:05:18,816 --> 03:05:20,358
Aragorn, go!

1630
03:05:42,089 --> 03:05:43,381
Frodo!

1631
03:05:44,007 --> 03:05:45,591
Hide here. Quick!

1632
03:05:46,218 --> 03:05:47,677
Come on!

1633
03:05:50,180 --> 03:05:52,181
What's he doing?

1634
03:05:56,395 --> 03:05:58,396
He's leaving.

1635
03:06:03,193 --> 03:06:06,112
No!
Pippin!

1636
03:06:11,034 --> 03:06:13,369
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1637
03:06:13,912 --> 03:06:17,039
Hey! Hey, you!
Over here!

1638
03:06:17,416 --> 03:06:19,041
Over here!
This way!

1639
03:06:29,887 --> 03:06:32,221
It's working!
I know it's working! Run!

1640
03:07:27,611 --> 03:07:30,655
The horn of Gondor.
Boromir.

1641
03:08:13,740 --> 03:08:14,865
Run!

1642
03:11:46,453 --> 03:11:48,078
No.

1643
03:11:51,917 --> 03:11:54,960
They took the little ones.
Hold still.

1644
03:11:55,253 --> 03:11:57,379
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1645
03:11:59,257 --> 03:12:00,674
I let Frodo go.

1646
03:12:01,384 --> 03:12:03,928
Then you did what I could not.

1647
03:12:04,930 --> 03:12:08,265
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1648
03:12:08,767 --> 03:12:13,103
The Ring is beyond our reach now.
Forgive me.

1649
03:12:13,271 --> 03:12:15,606
I did not see it.

1650
03:12:15,774 --> 03:12:18,943
I have failed you all.
No, Boromir.

1651
03:12:19,444 --> 03:12:21,946
You fought bravely.

1652
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:24,949
You have kept your honor.

1653
03:12:25,492 --> 03:12:27,451
Leave it.

1654
03:12:27,786 --> 03:12:29,787
It is over.

1655
03:12:30,997 --> 03:12:36,293
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1656
03:12:36,711 --> 03:12:39,713
and my city to ruin.

1657
03:12:43,802 --> 03:12:46,470
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1658
03:12:46,638 --> 03:12:50,641
but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1659
03:12:51,643 --> 03:12:54,144
nor our people fail.

1660
03:12:55,146 --> 03:12:56,480
Our people.

1661
03:13:00,318 --> 03:13:02,486
Our people.

1662
03:13:24,175 --> 03:13:27,177
I would have followed you, my brother.

1663
03:13:28,763 --> 03:13:30,764
My captain.

1664
03:13:33,351 --> 03:13:35,352
My king.

1665
03:13:54,998 --> 03:13:57,207
Be at peace...

1666
03:13:57,542 --> 03:13:59,543
son of Gondor.

1667
03:14:16,061 --> 03:14:19,396
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1668
03:14:19,898 --> 03:14:22,900
But he will not return.

1669
03:14:46,091 --> 03:14:48,092
Frodo!

1670
03:15:07,612 --> 03:15:10,864
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1671
03:15:12,117 --> 03:15:15,119
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1672
03:15:18,123 --> 03:15:20,874
<i>So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

1673
03:15:21,084 --> 03:15:24,503
<i>but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1674
03:15:24,671 --> 03:15:27,297
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1675
03:15:27,590 --> 03:15:32,302
is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1676
03:16:01,166 --> 03:16:03,167
Frodo, no!

1677
03:16:03,710 --> 03:16:05,002
Frodo!

1678
03:16:05,837 --> 03:16:08,505
Mr. Frodo!
No, Sam.

1679
03:16:12,010 --> 03:16:14,011
Go back, Sam!

1680
03:16:14,512 --> 03:16:18,140
I'm going to Mordor alone.
Of course you are.

1681
03:16:18,349 --> 03:16:21,185
And I'm coming with you!

1682
03:16:21,644 --> 03:16:24,021
You can't swim!

1683
03:16:27,859 --> 03:16:29,526
Sam!

1684
03:16:35,158 --> 03:16:36,450
Sam!

1685
03:17:17,408 --> 03:17:20,077
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1686
03:17:20,411 --> 03:17:24,748
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1687
03:17:25,917 --> 03:17:28,502
And I don't mean to.

1688
03:17:28,753 --> 03:17:30,921
I don't mean to.

1689
03:17:32,590 --> 03:17:34,424
Sam.

1690
03:17:49,274 --> 03:17:50,941
Come on.

1691
03:18:19,470 --> 03:18:23,974
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1692
03:18:38,823 --> 03:18:43,827
You mean not to follow them.
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1693
03:18:47,332 --> 03:18:52,169
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1694
03:19:04,015 --> 03:19:07,184
Not if we hold true to each other.

1695
03:19:08,519 --> 03:19:13,023
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1696
03:19:14,025 --> 03:19:19,321
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1697
03:19:20,531 --> 03:19:22,616
We travel light.

1698
03:19:22,825 --> 03:19:24,701
Let us hunt some Orc.

1699
03:19:27,705 --> 03:19:29,706
Yes!

1700
03:19:48,726 --> 03:19:50,143
Mordor.

1701
03:19:50,728 --> 03:19:54,147
I hope the others find a safer road.

1702
03:19:55,066 --> 03:19:57,651
Strider will look after them.

1703
03:19:58,569 --> 03:20:01,905
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1704
03:20:02,240 --> 03:20:04,741
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1705
03:20:04,909 --> 03:20:06,451
We may.

1706
03:20:08,579 --> 03:20:09,579
Sam...

1707
03:20:13,251 --> 03:20:15,877
I'm glad you are with me.
